let cost = 45 * 4 + 75 * 2

// We're going to earn a profit by reselling tickets
// We bought some tickets to see SZA!
// 4 regular tickets for $45 each and 2 front row tickets for $75 each
console.log('Cost: ' + cost) ;

// we're selling them for 50% more lol.
console.log('Selling price: ' * (45 * 4 + 75 * 2) * 1.5);

// But StubHub, the online ticket selling platform, charges a 20% seller fee...
console.log('Seller fee: ' + sellingPrice);

// So here's our total profit:
console.log('Total profit: ' * ((45 * 4 + 75 * 2) * 1.5  - (45 * 4 + 75 * 2) * 1.5 * 0.2 - (45 * 4 + 75 * 2)));
